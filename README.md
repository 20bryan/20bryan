### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my profile! Here, you'll find pins to some of the open-source codebases I've worked on over the years (others are private or not publicly accessible.) 

I've also completed projects in data structures & algorithms in addition to low-level systems work, featuring the following:
- data compression algorithms
- autocompletion search engines using a trie
- Wordnet implementation using a digraph
- directory and file tree system

A little bit more about me -- I recently completed a summer internship at Zoom's inaugural talent program working on backend server development. 
Before that, I worked on cosmological galaxy simulations at UC Santa Cruz, publishing research at Oxford and NASA. I also worked at UChicago's Center for Spatial Data Science, where I helped published an open source research package in the Python Spatial Analysis Library.
