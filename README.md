### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my profile! Here, you'll find pins to some of the open-source codebases I've worked on over the years (others are private or not publicly accessible.) 

I've also completed ground-up projects in operating systems and data structures & algorithms featuring the following:
- a six-part operating systems kernel w/ file system, inter-process management, etc.
- data compression algorithms
- an autocompletion search engine
- Wordnet implementation using a digraph

A little bit more about me -- I recently completed a summer internship at Zoom's inaugural talent program working on backend server development. 
Before that, I worked on cosmological galaxy simulations at UC Santa Cruz, publishing research at [Oxford](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/501/4/4948/6047185) and [NASA](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AAS...23335507W/abstract). I also worked at UChicago's Center for Spatial Data Science, where I helped published an [open source research package](https://access.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in the [Python Spatial Analysis Library](https://pysal.org/) (pinned below)!
